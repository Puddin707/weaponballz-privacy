  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><small>Last updated: 18 Oct 2025</small></p>

  <p><strong>Weapon Ball Z</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”) is a mobile game. This policy explains what data we collect, why, and your choices.</p>

  <h2>What we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account data (optional)</strong>: When you sign in with <em>Google Sign-In</em> via Firebase Authentication, we receive your Google user ID, display name, and email.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchases</strong>: Google Play Billing purchase tokens/receipts to deliver in-app items and handle refunds/fraud.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics</strong>: App-level events from <em>Firebase Analytics</em> (sessions, screens, in-game events) to improve gameplay.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash/Diagnostics</strong>: <em>Firebase Crashlytics</em> crash logs and device info (OS version, device model, app version) to fix stability issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising</strong>: Advertising identifiers (e.g., Google Advertising ID) and ad performance/interaction signals collected by our advertising partners to deliver, limit, and measure ads (e.g., <strong>AdMob</strong>, <strong>Unity Ads</strong>). Depending on your device/consent settings, ads may be personalized or non-personalized.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How we use data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide core functionality (login, cloud save, purchases).</li>
    <li>Analytics and product improvement.</li>
    <li>Security and fraud prevention.</li>
    <li>Advertising delivery and measurement.</li>
    <li>Customer support when you contact us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your data. We share data only with service providers necessary to operate the app, including:
    <br>• Google/Firebase (Authentication, Analytics, Crashlytics), Google Play Billing
    <br>• <strong>Advertising partners/SDKs</strong> to deliver and measure ads (e.g., AdMob/Unity Ads, or equivalent). These partners may receive advertising identifiers and ad interaction signals to provide their services.
  </p>
  <p><em>Where required (e.g., EEA/UK), we request user consent for personalized ads and honor your choices. If consent is not granted, ads will be served as non-personalized (NPA).</em></p>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <p>Account and purchase records are retained while your account is active and as required for fraud prevention and accounting, and otherwise only as long as necessary for the purposes described here. Analytics and crash data follow Firebase’s default retention. Advertising data retention is governed by our ad partners’ policies.</p>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic access is available, but most gameplay features (e.g., weapons and progression) require Google Sign-In.</li>
    <li>You can <strong>request deletion of your account and associated data</strong> via our web request page:
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/weaponballz-help">Deletion request page</a>
      or by emailing us from the signed-in Google account.</li>
    <li>Upon verification, we delete the Firebase Authentication profile and associated app records. Minimal purchase records may be retained as required for refunds/fraud and accounting. <strong>We generally process deletion requests within 14 days.</strong></li>
    <li>You can reset or limit ad tracking via your device settings (e.g., reset Advertising ID, limit ad personalization). Where platform consent is required, your choice will be honored.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The game is not directed to children under the digital consent age in your region. We do not knowingly collect data from children without appropriate consent.</p>

  <h2>Security & International Transfers</h2>
  <p>Data is encrypted in transit (TLS). Processing may occur on Google Cloud/Firebase or our partners’ infrastructure outside your country, with appropriate protections applied by those providers.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>Email: <a href="mailto:galacticozstudio@gmail.com">galacticozstudio@gmail.com</a></p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy over time and will post the new version on this page.</p>
